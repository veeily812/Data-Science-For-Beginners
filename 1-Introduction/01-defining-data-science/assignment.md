# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect? Any infomation display on the internet, through survey, interview, video.
1. How would you collect it? scrap it from the website, interview.
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be? data can be uploaded on the cloud, or local machine.
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data? insights from the data can be customer behavior, churn rate, etc.

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools? in this case i uses data for acess the student performance and predict the behavior of that student in the future.
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic? we can use data for identify patern in patient's symtem, or predict the risk of patients during pandemic.
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work? it might be counted by hours of working, how many task has done, and times of being disrupt or procasinating.
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | student dont know what they really like| student's behavior, acivity, academic performance | store in local machine| what is the student trait, suggest career |
| Vaccination | new virus so it less data about it |patient's data |  |we can predict the possibility of the disease happend |
| Productivity |acess the productivity at work|personal data |local machine |find out the factor impact  the productivity |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
